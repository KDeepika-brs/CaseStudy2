                        <p> The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a timely reminder of the nature and
                            impact of Public Health Emergencies of International Concern. As of 12 January 2022, there
                            were over 314 million cases and over 5.5 million deaths notified since the start of the
                            pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic takes variable shapes and forms, in terms of cases and
                            deaths, in different regions and countries of the world. The objective of this study is to
                            analyse the variable expression of COVID-19 pandemic so that lessons can be learned towards
                            an effective public health emergency response. In this we will get clarity about how many
                            people have affected due to COVID. And number of people have vaccinated till date.</p>

                        <p>During this project there are lot of challenges that came infront of me. There are lot of
                            datasets scrolling in internet so it's difficult to find the correct dataset for our
                            project. And also there are lot of obstacles in finding the output. Because of small
                            mistakes in the code it shows lot of errors and doesn't give the accurate output.

                                Before going into the project get clarity about what and how to get better results.<br>
                                Get good command on the coding.<br>

                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that every country remains vulnerable to public health
                            emergencies. The aspiration towards a healthier and safer society requires that countries
                            develop and implement a coherent and context-specific national strategy, improve governance
                            of public health emergencies.We have found that regions and countries with high human
                            development index have higher cases and deaths per million population due to COVID-19.
